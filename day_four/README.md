# Matrix Spiral Copy 

Given a matrix of integers as a 2D array, implement a function 
that copies the matrixâ€™s values into a 1D array in a clockwise 
spiral order. Your function should then return that array. 

Examples:
```
input: [
         [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
         [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
         [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
         [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]
       ]

output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 11, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 13, 12]
```
